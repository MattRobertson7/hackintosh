# System Components #

The most important part of building any hackintosh is choosing the right components. Those who try to wade these waters with untested hardware are in for a rude awakening. I spent >70% of my time researching the motherboard, CPU, Bluetooth/WiFi compatibility etc. Unfortunately, you are ultimately better off buying identical components to a build by someone else. I did something similar to this because I found that the Gigabyte Z370 Aorus Gaming 5 motherboard had been tried and tested by the hackintosher community. It works, but not without its quirks. Below is my final config. 

1. Intel i7-8700k Coffee Lake 3.6 GHz CPU
2. Gigabyte Z370 Aorus Gaming 5 Motherboard
3. NZXT Kraken x62 AIO Cooler
4. 64 GB Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200 MHz DDR4 RAM
5. Samsung 970 EVO NVMe PCIe m.2 SSD 1 TB
6. AMD Radeon Vega 64 Frontier Edition (16 GB HBM2)
7. NZXT h500i Case
8. Fenvi FV-T919 Bluetooth/WiFi PCIe card 


## Notes about system components for newbies ##

If you are new, please please find components that someone else has build a system with. It will save you a huge headache down the road. The most important components are the **motherboard**. Typically **Gigabyte** and **ASUS** boards are preferred and even then, there are specific boards that work better than others. For example, the Z370 Chipset boards of the AORUS series were very well seasoned in both Hackintoshes running High Sierra and Mojave, but as of late, Z390 boards are also apparently delivering fully functional hackintoshes. At the time of my build, the Z370 boards were going out of stock but after trying around at multiple vendors I was able to find an open-box motherboard at a hefty discount and it worked great.

Peripherals are also very important. Among them are the **video card** and **Bluetooth/Wifi devices**. As of this writing, Mojave does not support NVIDIA cards (because the web drivers are not available) and all AMD RX series video cards work right out of the box. I purchased a AMD Radeon Vega 64 Frontier Edition with 16GB of HBM2 VRAM which is probably overkill, but I got it used from a Cryptocurrency miner for cheap and it works flawlessly. AMD RX 570, 580 etc all work directly out of the box without any tweaking.  For Bluetooth and Wifi my motherboards chipset is unsupported by Apple so I bought this Fenvi FV-T919 PCIe card from NewEgg/Ebay for about 50 bucks. Works straight out of the box.

I will say this again, **spend most of your time researching the hardware you need. The better you hardware, the less time you will spend trying to get things working in your final hackintosh**.
